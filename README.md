# Winter Camp Project

This is a group project in the winter camp. The project is a book fetching system. The idea comes from our own difficulty in finding books in the library. Through the investigation, we find that there commonly exists several problems in the current library system and the difficulty in finding the book is among them, according to which, we figured out the idea of the Library Improvement and the fetching system is a part of it. 
***

In the fetching system, we use the robot arm in the library to help readers get the book they want automatically. By applying computer image processing, machine learning and several other techniques, the system can easily recognize the barcode and the text of the book and help match the readers’ requirements.

  + Project Framework:        Flask<br />
  + Frontend:                 Selenium UI<br />
